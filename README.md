## Problem Set 3
### Please answer the below questions:

#### A. Write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours). Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? If not, what are the problems with it? And, what else would you recommend to fix this problem at scale in production?
| Flask                                      | Django                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | 
| Micro-framework                            | Full Stack Framework                       | 
| Lightweight But, Extensible.               | Best for large & complex applications.     |
